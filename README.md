# gamebookasciijava
An exotic mix of book and game made for IDE in which the beginner developer will improve his knowledge about the logic of programming, methods, structures ...
(the game book it offers the developer in learning different problems for him to solve, he will only be able to solve these problems if he knows the basics of the java language. That game book is still in development and what is present in it is only the beginning of its menu, which is an ASCII art and some primary structures).
    NOTE:  the game book was developed on a samsung SM-J120H / DS, so it may not have the correct indentation.
